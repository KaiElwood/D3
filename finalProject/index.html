                <h3>Teen health seems to be the enigma of the century for researchers, parents, and even teens themselves.</h3>
                <p>Indeed, news articles frequently cite increasing depression rates among teenagers over the past few years as evidence of the negative effects of teens' infatuation with social media in particular. The Northwestern University Center on Media and Human Development's 2015 study "Teens, Health, and Technology" looks at how teens access health information – and its insights provide a window into teen behavior. The study directly asked teens about their health habits. The following graph plots answers to the question "People get information about health from many different sources. Please mark how much information about health topics you have gotten from each of the following:" </p>

                <h3>Teens primary sources of health information include parents, health classes in school, doctors and nurses, and the internet – but not social media.</h3>
                <p>This would suggest that teens are more skeptical of social media as a source of health information than is often portrayed in pop culture and the media. But how do teens rate the information they recieve from these sources? <br>Notably, teens are most satisfied by health information from parents and doctors/nurses – even though they go to doctors and nurses less frequently for health information. Also, 22 percent of respondents rated health information from books as very satisfying, even though only 10 percent seek them out "a lot". The following graph plots answers to the question "How satisfied are you with the health information you’ve gotten from: (the previous sources)" </p>

                <p>When asked about sensitive health information, 39 percent of teens responded that they are "very likely" to look up information online - more than responded "very likely" to talk to a doctor or their parents. The question specifically refers to birth control and depression as "sensitive health topics". How do answers change? The following graph plots answers to the question "If you had a question about a sensitive health topic (like birth control or depression), how likely would you be to do each of the following:" </p>

                <p>For questions about general health information,  The following graph plots answers to the question "If you had a question about a sensitive health topic (like birth control or depression), how likely would you be to do each of the following:" </p>

                <h2>So What?</h2>
                <h3>The data suggests that teens <em>underestimate</em> their propensity to look for health information online.</h3>
                <p>When asked about sensitive health information, 39 percent of teens responded that they are "very likely" to look up information online. When asked about general health information, 46 percent of teens responded that they are "very likely" to look up information online. Given that general and sensitive health information together make up all health information, the difference between 25 percent of teens that access online health information "a lot" and 39-46 percent that are "very likely" to look up health information online suggests that teens access health information online at higher rates than they expect to do so.</p>
                <h4>"Teens access health information online at higher rates than they expect to do so"</h4>
                <p>This has implications on health providers like colleges and high schools. The data suggests that <span>teens need easy to access and understand resources about health.</span></p>
